## Hi, Iâ€™m John!

I hold a Master of Computer Science and a Master of Arts in Linguistics from the University of Iowa. I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of an Agent Based Model to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants. See more about the project [here.](https://sewell.lab.uiowa.edu/pathome)
### Personal interests:
 - Formal verification and modeling
 - Design and theory of programming languages
 - AI for social good
 - I also love building projects that provide some personal utility in my life and the lives of those around me.
