## Hi, Iâ€™m John!

I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. My prior education includes a Master's in Linguistics and a Bachelor's of the Arts in Literature. I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of an Agent Based Modeling environment to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants. See more about the project here.[https://sewell.lab.uiowa.edu/pathome]

 - Automated theorem-proving
 - Type theory
 - I also love building projects that provide some personal utility in my life and the lives of those around me.
