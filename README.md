## Hi, Iâ€™m John!

I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. My prior education includes a Master's in Linguistics and a Bachelor's of the Arts in Literature. I'm always looking for a project that pushes the boundaries of my knowledge and experience. As a result, I have interests in a lot of different fields. 

### Personal interests:
 - AI for Social Good
 - Natural Language Processing
 - Automated theorem-proving
 - Homotopy type theory
 - I also love building projects that provide some personal utility in my life and the lives of those around me.
