## Hi, Iâ€™m John!

I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. My prior education includes a Master's in Linguistics and a Bachelor's of the Arts in Literature. I'm always looking for a project that pushes the boundaries of my knowlege and experience. As a result, I have interests in a lot of different fields. 

### Professional interests:
I am interested in technology to improve access to education and facilitate the needs of students and administrators of educational institutions.

I am also a strong proponent of clean and renewable energy, and am seeking opportunities to get involved in systems of energy production.

### Personal interests:
I am interested in Natural Language Processing and other applications of machine learning, including topological machine learning. 
I like to think about mathematical approaches to the theory of computing, and (conversely) questions in mathematical computing. 
I also (of course) love building projects that provide some personal utility in my life and the lives of those around me.
