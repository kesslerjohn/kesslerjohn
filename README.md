## Hi, Iâ€™m John!

I am a Master's candidate in Computer Science at the University of Iowa. I completed my Master's in Linguistics at the same institution. I am currently working with the PATHOME project team on the development of an Agent Based Modeling environment to predict which types of social, behavioral, and infrastructure interventions will most efficiently reduce transmission of enteric pathogens in infants. See more about the project [here.](https://sewell.lab.uiowa.edu/pathome)
### Personal interests:
 - Formal Language Theory
 - Automated model checking/verification
 - AI for social good
 - I also love building projects that provide some personal utility in my life and the lives of those around me.
